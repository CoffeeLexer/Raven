### What is this?
Have you heard of thing called Personal Computer game?

### What should I expect?
* Hidden biblical references
* Updates
* Updates on updates
* One persons struggle against CMake generation and linking problems
* Insanely out-of-box solutions to comprehend for simple problems to save 0.001% resources
***
### Technology specifications
* OpenGL (GLAD)
* GLFW

>*Why not vulkan?*

__While still learning, implementing/learning new algorithms > spending 2 hours to implement something which is easy in concept, rather them using simple function (mip maps)__

>*Still though, more efficiency?*

__Life is learning experience, later on after being proficient in graphics, council of knights who say Ni will consider possibility of adapting new trade__
